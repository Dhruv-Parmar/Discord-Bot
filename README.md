A Discord bot using Discord.py to help us play Cypher System via chat. 

This code is (imo very) badly designed, but I doubt anyone outside our friend group is going to use it so it doesn't really matter. 

Will update readme later.

How to not break this aweful code:
1) Watch for case sensitivity for commands and their parameters
2) Don't use new line in the template. Keep each stat on one line, even if it's really long
3) Don't swap around stats on the character template
4) Keep copy of character sheets in case something goes wrong
5) Dont put spaces in chacter name and don't name yourself "all"
